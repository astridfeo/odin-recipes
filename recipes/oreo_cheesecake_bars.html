        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 325Â°. Line an 8"-x-8" baking dish with parchment paper with a 2" overhang.

            <li>Top with a single layer of Oreos, breaking them up to fit, if necessary, and set aside.</li>
            <li>Make cheesecake layer: In a medium bowl using a handheld mixer or stand mixer with the paddle attachment, 
                beat cream cheese until smooth. 
                Beat in sugar, eggs, vanilla, and salt until fully combined. 
                Pour over Oreo layer and smooth top.</li>
            <li>Top with broken Oreo pieces and bake until the center is only slightly jiggly, 30 to 35 minutes.</li>
            <li>Refrigerate until completely chilled, at least 3 hours and up to overnight.</li>
            <li>Remove cheesecake bar from baking dish and slice. Drizzle with warm caramel before serving.</li>
